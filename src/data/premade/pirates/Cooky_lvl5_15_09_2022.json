If there isn’t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attack with them deal 1d4 extra damage.\n\nReduce. The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category – from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can’t reduce the damage below 1).","casting_time":"1 Action","components":"V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)","duration":"up to 1 minute","upcasting":"","half_damage_save":"","save_required":"con","effect_summary":"Make objects/creatures bigger or smaller","ritual":"","concentration":"yes","bonus_damage_dice":"","bonus_damage_dice_num":"","bonus_damage_dice_type":""},{"attack_id":15,"attack_type":"spell","attack_name":"Slow","mod_used":"","attack_bonus":0,"bonus_attack_bonus":"0","damage_bonus":0,"bonus_damage_bonus":0,"damage_dice":"","damage_dice_num":0,"damage_type":"","range":"120ft","tags":"","ammo":0,"magic":"","school":"Transmutation","spell_level":"3","description":"You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range.

Regardless of the creature’s abilities or magic items, it can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.\n\nIf the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20.
